		<h2>While I am taking a test I am redirected to the home screen and logged out</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>The most likely reason is that you have more than one Internet browser or tab open which is logged in to Bond. Bond works best when you use just one screen at a time.</p>
		<p>Did this help? If not then the security settings on your browser may be interfeering with Bond, try using a different Internet browser.</p>
		<p>If this did not help then contact our support team and let us know your username and the Internet browser that you are using.</p>

		<hr>
		<ol>
		<li>Look at the <strong>example question</strong> for the test. This will give you an idea of the type of question in the test.</li>

		<li>Read the feedback against your marked answers. This should help you understand why your answer was right or wrong. </li>
		</ol>
		<p>The more you do the tests, the more you will get used to the different types of questions and the answers they are looking for.</p>
