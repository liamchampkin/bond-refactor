		<h3>What is the 11 Plus?</h3>
		<p>The 11+ is an optional examination that is used in areas that have retained grammar schools or for those seeking entrance to some selective private senior school to identify the most academically-able children. It is taken towards the  end of Year 5 or beginning of Year 6 of primary school education.</p>
		<p>It is used purely for senior school selection and has no bearing on SATs or GCSE results.</p>
		<p>The 11+ exam generally focus on one or a combination of four subjects: English, maths, verbal reasoning and non-verbal reasoning. Although the maths and English tests tend to follow the National Curriculum, the verbal and non-verbal reasoning tests are not school-based subjects and will not be taught as part of the curriculum in state schools.</p>
		<p>11+ tests can be either in standard format (SF), or multiple-choice (MC). Standard format tests require the child to write their answer in a space provided close to the question, whilst multiple-choice papers usually ask the child to select from a range of options and mark their answer on a separate answer sheet that has the answer options in a grid format.</p>
