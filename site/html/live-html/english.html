		<ul>
		<li>11+ comprehension exercises, where children have to read pieces of text and answer questions on them</li>
		<li>11+ writing tasks, where children have to write something themselves</li>
		<li>Punctuation and grammar problems, where children show their understanding of how English works as a language</li>
		<li>Spelling tasks, where children spot incorrect spellings</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There are two different formats for 11+ English exam papers. Questions can either be presented in standard or multiple-choice layout. Standard is where a child writes his or her answers on the question paper. Multiple-choice is where possible answers are given on the paper and a child marks his or her chosen answer on a separate booklet.<br /><br />As with all exams, 11+ English papers are timed and they usually last from 45 minutes to one hour. Children therefore need to practise with timed 11+ mock test papers as well as working through non-timed practice, so they can see what they are able to do within a given time frame.</p>

		<h3> A good time to check up on basic skills is the summer term of Year 4. That gives you the summer holidays to:</h3>
		
		<ul>
		<li>Practice and reinforce any knowledge or skills that are a little shaky</li>
		<li>Stock up on reading materials</li>
		<li>Keep a diary or write a summer project.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Once your child is settled into Year 5, it is important to establish a regular routine of bedtime reading (if that’s not already part of your child’s life) and a couple of quiet, uninterrupted sessions a week for practice.</p>
