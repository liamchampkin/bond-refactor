		<h2>11+ Maths</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>11+ maths tests cover a broad spectrum of maths principles and concepts. They examine how effectively a child can understand and manipulate numbers. 11+ maths exams may differ from region to region, but a paper will generally require children to display:</h3>

		<ul>
	    <li>The ability to think and calculate quickly</li>
	    <li>Sound knowledge of multiplication tables</li>
	    <li>The ability to apply the four number operations (+ - x ÷) accurately</li>
	    <li>A fundamental understanding of number relationships, measurement, mental arithmetic, geometry and data handling</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>A good time to check up on basic maths skills is the summer term of Year 4. That gives you the summer holidays to:</h3>

    <ul>
    	<li>practise and reinforce any knowledge or skills that are a little shaky</li>
    	<li>consolidate tables and number bonds</li>
    	<li>practise halving and doubling numbers</li>
    	<li>become familiar with different types of measurement using activities such as cooking.</li>
    </ul>
		
		<p>Once your child is settled into Year 5, it is important to establish a regular routine of practising tables – try to introduce a couple of quiet, uninterrupted sessions a week for practice.</p>

		<p>It is best to practise little and often, with an emphasis on quick thinking and rapid feedback. In 11+ maths, children are expected to show dexterity in manipulating numbers and the ability to solve problems of all kinds logically and with understanding.</p>
		<p>Remember your child should be covering all aspects of maths that he or she will need for the 11+ exam at school. Working to prepare for 11+ maths outside school should therefore focus on highlighting particular difficulties, consolidating skills and developing time management skills.</p>
