	<h3>Purchasing and Cancelling Bond Online</h3>

	<div style="width: 600px; padding-left: 30px;"><em><br />Please note: the ongoing payment of £5.99 per month will continue to be debited from your card until you cancel your subscription. <br /></em></div>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="21a"></a><span>How do I cancel my monthly subscription?</span></div>
	Subject to your statutory rights (including your rights under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 ("Consumer Contracts Regulations") implementing the Consumer Rights Directive 2011/83/EU), Monthly subscriptions have a minimum subscription period of three months.

	<li>Click the cancel button next to your child's username.</li>
	<li>Follow the instructions on screen to cancel the subscription.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
	<li><strong>How to renew an Annual Subscription</strong> -  Your annual subscription does not automatically renew and no further payments are taken.

	<p>Do you have more than one Internet browser (or browser tab) open which is logged in to Bond? Try using one screen with no other tabs open.</p>

	<h3>General Eleven Plus Queries</h3>
	<div class="highlighter first"><a name="7"></a><span>Where can I find out about the 11 Plus exams?</span></div>
	<p>It can be difficult to find any detailed information about the 11 Plus exam system. With no published curriculum and many schools preferring not to publish the content of their exams, the 11 Plus has an air of mystery about it. Different Local Authorities and senior schools set different combinations of tests, making it hard to choose 11 Plus resources to meet everyone's needs.</p>
	<p>For some Local Authorities, the 11 Plus is available to all Year 6 children and taken in class. In other parts of the country, the 11 Plus is organised and hosted by the senior school and taken after school or during a weekend.</p>
	<p>The 11 Plus is a way of testing children from an academic perspective and has no bearing on their SATs or GCSEs.</p>
	<p>Bond offers an essential and invaluable manual that takes you through the whole 11 Plus process in a clear, practical, step-by-step manner: The Parents' Stress-free Guide to the 11 Plus.</p>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="8"></a><span>How can I explain an answer to my child when I can't work out the question myself?</span></div>
	<p>If you subscribe to Bond Online, questions are given for each topic and your child will get instant feedback on the correct and incorrect answers to explain why they got them right or wrong.</p>
	<p>All Bond 11 Plus Assessment Papers designed for ages 9-13 years now include a simple cross-referencing system that refers directly to the related section in the relevant tutorial guide, and each pack of 11 Plus Test Papers provides a detailed explanation for every answer as well as links to the relevant tutorial guide.</p>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="9"></a><span>How can my child's scores for the 11 Plus be improved?</span></div>
	<p>Specific advice and guidance on improving 11 plus scores can now be found in:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>the preliminary notes and the 'Next Steps Planner' in each Bond 11 Plus Assessment Papers title </li>
	<li>the introductory sections and parent tips found throughout each of the four 'How to do … 11 Plus' tutorial guides</li>
	<li>'The secrets of 11 Plus success' booklet included with each pack of 11 Plus Test Papers. </li>
	</ul>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="10"></a><span>How do I know how well my child is doing?</span></div>
	<p>If you subscribe to Bond Online, you will be able to track your child's progress, see their marks for each test, identify strengths and weaknesses and see where and how much they are improving.</p>
	<p>With Bond Assessment Papers each title contains a progress chart that enables a child to record their score for each paper. In addition, each of the four 'How to do … 11 Plus' tutorial guides includes a full-length practice paper that can be set as a 'before and after' test to check a child's progress.</p>
	<p>Detailed parental advice on checking general ability, as well as specific subject skills, is included in the four subject tutorial guides and throughout The Parents' Stress-free Guide to the 11 Plus.</p>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="11"></a><span>How can Bond Online help my child improve?</span></div>
	<p>As your child builds up a score profile for each question type, it will become clear which questions they are struggling with and which ones they are excellent at. It's important to have had quite a few goes at each question type so that a clear picture emerges. It's then easy to target practice on the more tricky types of question.</p>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="12"></a><span>What is the difference between the questions in the Bond books and the <strong>Bond Online</strong> tests?</span></div>
	<p>The vast majority of questions in <strong class="unweight">Bond Online</strong> are new questions developed specifically for <strong class="unweight">Bond Online</strong>. Only around 25% or less of the Verbal Reasoning and Non-verbal Reasoning questions and a much smaller percentage of the Maths questions, have been taken from existing questions in our range of <strong class="unweight">Bond books</strong>.</p>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="13"></a><span>Who has written the questions for Bond Online?</span></div>
	<p>The questions have all been written by experienced tutors and teachers. It is the same team which has contributed to many of the <strong class="unweight">Bond books</strong>. As well as J. M. Bond herself, the authors are Jane Bayliss, David Clemson, Frances Down, Sarah Lindsay, Nicola Morgan, Alison Primrose and Malcolm Thomas.</p>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="14"></a><span>What's the best way to motivate my child?</span></div>
	<p>Subscribing to Bond Online means that your child gets easy access to questions and instant feedback on their answers. Being able to try out different answers, do the same test again and again and see their score immediately can be highly motivating.</p>
	<p>Bond books also offer practical ideas and tips that should help your child stay motivated during practice sessions for the 11 Plus. In particular, look out for:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>the 'Bond motivational planner' system inside The Parents' Stress-free Guide to the 11 Plus</li>
	<li>the puzzle pages in each 10 Minute Tests titles for English, Maths, Verbal Reasoning &amp; Non-verbal Reasoning</li>
	<li>ideas for games and tutors' top tips for parents throughout the four 'How to do … 11 Plus' tutorial guides. </li>
	</ul>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="15"></a><span>How can I help my child with comprehension and writing tasks for the 11 Plus?</span></div>
	<p>The Bond range of 11 Plus tutorial guides has now been expanded to incorporate two new titles that deal specifically with the knowledge and skills required to successfully tackle these aspects of English: The Parents' Stress-free Guide to the 11 Plus:The secrets of Comprehension and The secrets of Writing.</p>
	<p>In addition comprehension practice can be found within:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Bond Online </li>
	<li>each practice paper across the range of Bond Assessment Papers for English </li>
	<li>the English range of bite-sized 10 Minute Tests</li>
	<li>each mock test in the packs of 11 Plus English Test Papers</li>
	<li>specific writing practice is provided by the new Writing Tasks in each pack of 11 Plus English Test Papers. </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Bond Online Tests</h3>
	<div class="highlighter first"><a name="16"></a><span>How many tests are there in <strong>Bond Online</strong>?</span></div>
	<p>There are 20 different Maths tests, 21 Verbal Reasoning tests, 10 Non-verbal Reasoning tests, and 5 English tests. Each test has 10 questions, taken randomly from a bank of 40-50 questions for Maths, Verbal Reasoning, and Non-verbal Reasoning, and 110-150 questions for English. In total for each subject <strong>Bond Online</strong> has anywhere between 500 - 900 different questions.</p>
	<p>Each 'subject' also contain Mock Tests.</p>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="17"></a><span>How long is a test?</span></div>
	<p>Each test contains ten questions. This allows children to do lots of bite-sized practice whenever they want.</p>
	<p>Mock tests contain more questions and are timed.</p>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="18"></a><span>Every time my child repeats the same test, will it be the same questions?</span></div>
	<p>Ten questions are chosen randomly from a bank of 40 to 50 questions, so the tests will never be exactly the same.</p>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="18a"></a><span>What are the rules about spelling, punctuation, decimal numbers and marking accuracy?</span></div>
	<p>Spelling - pay careful attention to spelling. A question will be marked wrong if spelling is incorrect.</p>
	<p>Punctuation - pay careful attention to any instructions within a question regarding punctation. Where appropriate incorrect punctuation will result in an incorrect mark (e.g. use of full stops, apostrophes or speech marks).</p>
	<p>Decimal places - in questions where it is appropriate we will mark answers containing decimals places as correct, even where a decimal place is not needed. However, children should be aware that in 11+ exams this may not always be the case and we advise them to give answers in whole numbers where no decimals are included in the question (e.g. avoid 4 + 4 = 8.0).</p>
	<h3>Security</h3>
	<div class="highlighter first"><a name="26"></a><span>Will it be a safe environment for my children to be in?</span></div>
	<p>Once your children log into their <strong class="unweight">Bond Online</strong> account they are in a safe area that does not connect to any other websites.</p>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="27"></a><span>Will my children's identities be protected?</span></div>
	<p>Your children's account details are created and managed by you in your <strong class="unweight">Bond</strong> account. We do not keep these details in our marketing database.</p>
	<div class="highlighter"><a name="27a"></a><span>Does Bond Online use cookies?</span></div>
	<p>Cookies are small data files which are saved on your computer as you use a website.</p>
	<p>Bond Online uses cookies to track and measure website performance - the data that is collected is anonymous and we only use it to monitor and improve this website. (It is never shared with any third party.)</p>
	<p>Bond Online also requires some cookies so that the website will perform correctly - some features are only available if these functionality cookies are enabled.</p>

	<div class="highlighter"><a name="29"></a><span>How secure is my Bond Online payment?</span></div>
	<p>The Bond Online shop uses <a href="http://www.worldpay.com/index.php?c=UK" target="_blank">Worldpay</a> to handle all online payments. Worldpay is the UK's leading online payment provider which means you can be confident your transaction is totally secure.</p>

	<div class="highlighter"><a name="30"></a><span>I can't see the usual padlock indicating that the site is secure?</span></div>
	<p>This is probably because you're using Firefox. The way in which Firefox indicates the security of a site has changed with the release of version 4, whereby the image of the padlock has been replaced with a coloured bar positioned to the left of the web page address. This indicates the security/identity state of a connection and on clicking will display the full details of the security certificate. A blue or green coloured bar indicates that the site is secure, red is insecure.</p>
